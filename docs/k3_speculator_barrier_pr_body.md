## Purpose

**Fixes a boot blocker for decode context parallelism (DCP) combined with speculative decoding: the DFlash/DSpark speculator faults during CUDA graph capture.**

When the DFlash/DSpark draft is **DCP-sharded**, the graph captured by `DFlashSpeculator.capture()` contains a context-parallel collective. Graph capture is only safe when every rank enters it aligned: a rank still finishing earlier work can have its collective recorded into a peer's graph, which faults. Nothing currently quiesces or aligns the ranks before `capture()` runs.

Symptom: every rank dies in `Capturing model for DSpark speculator...` with
`Memory access fault by GPU node-N ... Reason: Unknown`, at a **fresh fault address each time**, with a clean teardown.

**It is a race, not an out-of-bounds access.** The decisive evidence is that booting the same configuration with `AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL=3 HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` **succeeds**: a configuration that only fails when kernels overlap is a race by construction. The logs show ranks entering `capture()` staggered by ~1 s.

### Why this has not been reported before

The precondition is a **sharded** draft. The replicated draft of #51705 ran at `dcp=1`, so its captured graph contained no collective and there was nothing to race. That changed with **#55472** (merged 2026-09-08), which rebuilds the draft's `ParallelConfig` from the target's and therefore preserves `decode_context_parallel_size`, so a `--decode-context-parallel-size N` run with a DSpark draft now gets a draft at `dcp=N`. The window in which this is reachable upstream is about a week old.

**Reproduction:** multi-rank, `decode_context_parallel_size > 1`, DSpark draft, CUDA graphs enabled. It is a startup race, so it is timing-dependent rather than deterministic; serializing kernel launches masks it.

This adds that alignment, and only where it is needed:

```python
if self.vllm_config.parallel_config.decode_context_parallel_size > 1:
    torch.accelerator.synchronize()
    get_dcp_group().barrier()
```

Three things worth calling out:

- **Gated on DCP.** With `decode_context_parallel_size == 1` the draft is not sharded, the captured graph holds no collective, and a barrier would additionally require an initialised process group on the single-GPU path. The gate reads the *draft's* config (`self.vllm_config` is the draft-adjusted one), so it tracks whatever the draft actually runs.
- **`GroupCoordinator.barrier()`, not `torch.distributed.barrier()`.** This is a correctness point, not style. The latter is an NCCL barrier, which (per its own docstring in `parallel_state.py`) "is internally a broadcast operation with secretly created GPU tensors. It is easy to mess up the current device." Doing that immediately before graph capture is exactly the wrong thing; `GroupCoordinator.barrier()` uses the CPU group instead. A test pins the choice so a later simplification cannot quietly undo it.
- **Boot-time only**, once per speculator. No steady-state cost.

### Scope: ROCm only

Gated on `current_platform.is_rocm()`. The fault was measured on gfx950 and the
fix is untested on CUDA, so other platforms keep their current behaviour rather
than take an unverified change to graph capture. DCP is not backend-specific, so
the same staggered-entry fault may exist there; we have no way to exercise it.
Widening it is one condition if a maintainer can test it.

### Scope and placement

One-shot alignment is sufficient: the **target's** `CudaGraphManager.capture`
already loops many sizes with DCP collectives in the graph and no barrier at all,
and that works. What fails is the draft, where ranks arrive from target capture
up to ~1s apart. The barrier sits between the target's `graph_capture()` exiting
and the draft's entering, so it runs outside any capture-stream context.

**Why the TP group.** `__init__` forces the draft to `prefill_context_parallel_size=1`,
and at `pcp == 1` config validation requires `tp % dcp == 0`
(`config/parallel.py:562`), so the draft's DCP group is a subset of its TP group.
The captured draft graph carries the draft's TP all-reduces as well as the DCP
collective, so at `dcp < tp` a DCP barrier would align only some participants:
`tp=8/dcp=2` gives `[[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],[6,7]]` against a graph spanning all 8
ranks. At `dcp == tp` they coincide, which is why the measurement below does not
discriminate between the two. TP is the full set either way, at the same cost.

**No PP deadlock.** The speculator is built only on the last PP rank
(`model_runner.py:279`), and every DCP and TP group lies within a single PP
stage, so either all members reach the barrier or none do.

**It runs twice per boot**, not once: `profile_cudagraph_memory()` bootstraps a
throwaway KV cache and runs `capture_model()` for the memory estimate, which
reaches `speculator.capture()` too. Symmetric across ranks and harmless, and
profiling is where ranks are most staggered.

### Reproduction on unmodified main

The passing 8x MI355X run used a local port that shards the draft. Upstream
reachability is argued from #55472 (which copies the target's `ParallelConfig`
into the draft, making a sharded draft reachable on stock main) rather than
demonstrated on a vanilla boot. Stated plainly so a reviewer can weigh it.

### Relationship to #56723

#56723 touches the same file: it adds `draft_parallel_config()` and rewires `__init__`. The two are **independent and compose**: it does not touch `capture()`, and it refines the draft's effective DCP, which is exactly the value this gate reads. Note the skip-under-PCP behaviour is **not** on this branch today: `__init__` currently forces `prefill_context_parallel_size=1` but leaves `decode_context_parallel_size` alone, so with PCP on the gate still fires. **If** #56723 lands, it collapses the draft's DCP to 1 and this barrier then correctly no-ops under PCP; that PR is unmerged, so this is conditional on it. With PCP off it returns the config unchanged and the barrier applies either way.

There is no logic overlap; whichever lands second needs a one-line rebase of the import block.

## Test Plan

```bash
pytest tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_capture_dcp_barrier.py

# no regression in the neighbouring speculator tests
pytest tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_prepare_inputs.py \
       tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_causality.py
```

**These are unit tests, not a regression test, and that is a deliberate limitation.** The bug is a multi-rank boot-time race; reproducing it needs several ranks and a real capture, which no unit test can do. They instead pin the three properties that prevent it:

1. under DCP, the device is quiesced and the ranks aligned, and both happen **before** capture begins (asserted on call order, not just call count);
2. with DCP off, neither happens, so the single-GPU path pays nothing and needs no process group;
3. the barrier goes through the DCP `GroupCoordinator` and **not** `torch.distributed.barrier()`.

The speculator is constructed with `object.__new__` and only the attributes `capture()` dereferences, so no draft model is loaded and the tests run anywhere.

## Test Result

```
tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_capture_dcp_barrier.py  3 passed
tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_prepare_inputs.py
tests/v1/spec_decode/test_dflash_causality.py           16 passed
```

Removing the two barrier lines turns the ordering test red:

```
with the barrier removed:  1 failed, 2 passed
with the barrier present:  3 passed
```

Measured on 8x MI355X (gfx950, ROCm 7.2.3), Kimi-K3 + DSpark, world size 8 with
TP=8 and DCP=8. Both attention groups are sharded: target `num_heads=12 dcp=8
decode_num_heads=96`, draft `num_heads=8 dcp=8 decode_num_heads=64`.

Every boot died at speculator capture. With the barrier the server reaches
`Application startup complete` in 280 s with no serialization penalty, and a
full concurrency sweep then ran 9/9 `rc=0`.

Two limits on what this measures. The stack carries a local port that makes the
DSpark draft DCP-sharded, so upstream reachability rests on the #55472 argument
above rather than on a boot from an unmodified tree. And at DCP == TP the two
groups are the same 8 ranks, so this run cannot tell a TP barrier from a DCP
one; the choice of TP is argued from config validation, not measured.
